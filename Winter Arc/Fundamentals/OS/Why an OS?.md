## Concept Overview

If you build an application on your **own custom OS**, that application will only run on **that specific system**. It won’t work anywhere else because your OS defines how hardware and software communicate.  
Apple follows a similar philosophy: they design both their **hardware (M1, M2, M3 chips)** and **software (macOS, iOS)**, ensuring tight integration and maximum performance — but also reducing portability.

### Key Points

- **The OS is software** that acts as a middle layer between hardware and applications.
    
- It **keeps track of all hardware components** — CPU, memory, disks, network, peripherals.
    
- It **manages and allocates resources** among different programs.
    
- Applications **don’t talk directly to hardware** — they talk to the **OS via system calls or APIs**.
    
- **General-purpose OSs** like **Windows** or **Linux** are designed to run on a wide range of hardware — they’re portable and flexible.

## Scheduling in Operating Systems

**Scheduling** is the process of deciding _which process gets to use resources (CPU, memory, I/O)_ and _when_.  
It’s one of the **most critical** parts of OS design — even minor inefficiencies can lead to massive performance drops.
### Core Ideas

- The OS must **fairly distribute resources** among processes:
    
    - **CPU time** → controls how long each process runs before switching.
        
    - **Memory** → allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.
        
    - **I/O (Input/Output)** → coordinates access to disks and devices.
    
- Example: A hard drive can handle only a **limited number of I/O operations per second (IOPS)** — the OS must schedule and queue them efficiently.
    
- Database engines like **InnoDB** use OS-level I/O scheduling and sometimes define their own **I/O capacity** settings.
    
- **CPU Scheduling** is particularly complex — optimizing it involves algorithms, heuristics, and trade-offs between fairness and throughput.
    
    - Historically, even systems like **Windows 3.1** had poor schedulers, leading to lag and instability.
        
    - Entire **PhDs** have been written on scheduling algorithms and performance tuning.

## Why Do We Need an Operating System?

1. **Hardware Abstraction:**  
    The OS provides APIs that hide the messy details of hardware — developers interact with a consistent interface instead of writing low-level driver code.
    
2. **Portability:**  
    Applications built on standard OS APIs can run on any hardware where that OS runs — no need to rewrite for every device.
    
3. **Compatibility Maintenance:**  
    The OS maintains backward compatibility, though **occasional breaking changes** occur (like the jump from 32-bit to 64-bit architectures).

## Summary

- The **Operating System manages resources** — CPU, memory, and I/O devices.
    
- It **schedules processes** to ensure efficiency and fairness.
    
- It **maintains compatibility** and shields developers from hardware complexity.
    
- A solid understanding of OS internals makes you a **better engineer**, capable of writing efficient, scalable, and portable software.
