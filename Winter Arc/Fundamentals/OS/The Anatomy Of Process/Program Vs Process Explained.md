This is one of those core CS fundamentals that most devs skip, yet it’s what separates “I can code” from “I understand what my machine is doing.”  
Here’s your cleaned-up and expanded version with some real-world clarity and depth added.

# 🧠 Programs, Linking & Executables

A **program** is the _compiled and linked_ result of source code — transformed into **machine instructions** that a specific CPU architecture can execute.

---

## ⚙️ From Source Code → Executable

### 1. **Compilation**

- Each `.c`, `.cpp`, `.rs`, `.go`, or `.swift` file is **compiled** into an **object file (`.o`)**.
    
- These object files contain:
    
    - Machine-level instructions
        
    - Symbol tables (function and variable names)
        
    - Metadata for linking
        
- Object files are **CPU-architecture specific** — x86, ARM, RISC-V, etc.
    

> Example: compiling for ARM won’t run on x86 — instruction sets differ.

---

### 2. **Linking**

The **linker** takes all object files and combines them into one **executable binary**.

#### 🧩 Static Linking

- All dependent libraries (functions, symbols) are **copied directly** into the executable.
    
- Produces a **large, self-contained binary**.
    
- No runtime dependencies — portable, but heavy.
    
- Used in embedded systems or Go binaries.
    

#### 🔗 Dynamic Linking

- Instead of copying libraries, the linker stores **pointers/references** to external libraries.
    
- At runtime, the **loader** finds and links these libraries in memory.
    
- Much smaller binaries, but if the required library (`.dll`, `.so`, `.dylib`) is missing →  
    ❌ “**Dynamic Library Not Found**” error.
    

> Example:
> 
> - **Windows:** `.dll` (Dynamic Link Library)
>     
> - **Linux:** `.so` (Shared Object)
>     
> - **macOS:** `.dylib`
>

### 3. **Executable Formats**

Once linked, the final binary is written in a specific **executable file format** understood by the OS and loader:

|OS|Executable Format|Example|
|---|---|---|
|Linux|ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)|`/bin/bash`|
|macOS|Mach-O|`/usr/bin/ls`|
|Windows|PE (Portable Executable)|`C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`|

Each format defines:

- How code, data, and symbols are laid out in memory
    
- Where the **entry point** (`main()`) is
    
- How to perform dynamic linking
    

---

### 4. **CPU Architecture Dependency**

Executables are **tied to their CPU instruction set**:

- x86, x86_64, ARM, RISC-V — all have different opcodes
    
- Apple’s M1/M2/M3 chips (ARM-based) require binaries built for ARM
    
- That’s why Apple uses **Rosetta** to emulate x86 apps on ARM Macs
    

> “Compile once, run anywhere” only works if you’re compiling to **a common intermediate layer** (like JVM bytecode or WebAssembly).

---

### 5. **At Rest**

When not running:

- The program **lives on disk** as a static executable file.
    
- It becomes **a process** only when loaded into memory by the OS loader.

## 🧩 Recap

|Stage|Purpose|Output|
|---|---|---|
|Compile|Turn source → object code|`.o` files|
|Link|Combine objects + libraries|`.exe`, ELF, etc.|
|Load|OS loads binary to memory|Running **process**|

---

### ⚡ Summary

- **Program**: compiled + linked machine code for a specific CPU
    
- **Linker**: glues together all compiled parts
    
- **Static linking**: everything baked into the binary
    
- **Dynamic linking**: shared libraries loaded at runtime
    
- **Executable format**: defines how OS loads and executes code
    
- **Lives on disk** → becomes a **process in memory** when run

## Process
- when a program is run, we get a process
- Stack/Heap => Get the expliantion
- Process lives in memory
- Uniqly identified with an id
- Instructuion pointer/program counter
