## 🧱 Stack Pointer (SP) — The CPU’s Memory Tracker

### 🔹 What it is:

The **Stack Pointer (SP)** is a **special CPU register** that **always points to the top of the stack** —  
the current “end” of the active function’s memory.

Think of it as a marker showing:

> “Where is the latest allocated memory on the stack right now?”

### 🔹 What the stack does:

Every time you call a function:

- CPU **allocates a new stack frame** (local variables, return address, saved registers, etc.)
    
- **SP moves down** (because stack grows from high → low addresses)
    

When the function returns:

- CPU **deallocates** that frame
    
- **SP moves back up** to where it was before

### 🧩 Example

Let’s visualize your code step-by-step:

#### Step 1 — Before `main()` starts

```
       (empty stack)
       ---------
0xff999F |       |
          ↓
        SP = 0xff999F
```

#### Step 2 — `main()` starts, allocate `int a`

```
       ---------
0xff9999 | int a |  ← allocated
          ---------
           SP = 0xff9999
```

#### Step 3 — Allocate `int b`, `int c`

```
          ---------
0xff9991 | int c |
0xff9995 | int b |
0xff9999 | int a |
          ---------
           SP = 0xff9991
```

Stack grew **downward** from `0xff9999 → 0xff9991`.

#### Step 4 — Deallocate `int c` (function returning or freeing space)

```
          ---------
0xff9995 | int b |
0xff9999 | int a |
          ---------
           SP = 0xff9995
```

### 🔹 Why it’s fast

- The stack pointer (`SP`) is just a **CPU register** → 1 ns access.
    
- Allocation/deallocation is **just pointer arithmetic**:
    
    ```asm
    sub sp, sp, #4   ; allocate 4 bytes
    add sp, sp, #4   ; deallocate 4 bytes
    ```
    
    No OS call, no heap management — instant.

### 🔹 Summary Table

|Action|What happens|SP movement|
|---|---|---|
|Function call|Create new frame|Moves **down**|
|Local variable allocation|Reserve bytes|Moves **down**|
|Function return|Destroy frame|Moves **up**|
|Stack overflow|Stack grows beyond limit|Crash 💥|

---

### 🧠 Key Points

- Stack grows **High → Low**
    
- `SP` = special CPU register tracking top of stack
    
- Super fast for temporary allocations (local vars, function calls)
    
- Freed automatically when function ends
